# Github Activity

Github Activity is a way to take control of your Github Watcher list.  Currently,
it is too difficult to keep up to date with projects in your activity feeds due 
to some more active projects drowning out everything else (I'm looking at you, 
rails/rails!).  Github Activity aims to fix this probem by  giving you tools to
easily view updates for projects in a more organized and filtered way.
  
This project started as an [entry](http://nodeasaurus.nko2.nodeknockout.com) in 
[NodeKnockout](http://www.nodeknockout.com/) but is continuing active development.
If you would like to contribute, feel free to fork and send a pull request.  There
is still plenty to do in a post-hackathon universe. :)
